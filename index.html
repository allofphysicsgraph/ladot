Ladot is a script that makes using LaTeX in graphs generated by dot
(<a href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/">graphviz</a>)
relatively easy.  This is primarily so that one can include math expressions
in one's graphs (the kind with nodes and edges, not the kind with axes).
Ladot
does no "real work" on its own; it merely cuts out some of the steps involved
in using
<a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/psfrag.html?action=/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/psfrag/">psfrag</a> to insert arbitrary LaTeX snippets into arbitrary PostScript
files.
<p>

Ladot is easy to use and gets the core of the job done, but it is also
simplistic: it should be considered a proof-of-concept which may set an
example for slicker solutions -- for example, something which uses an
existing GraphViz API, instead of Perl regular expressions, is
definitely desireable.  Users should read the "Limitations" section in
the README so they are not frustrated by unexpectedly absent
functionality. <p>

<h2>Current version</h2> <ul>
